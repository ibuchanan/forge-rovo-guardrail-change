# Automated Deployment of Monthly Security Patch to Web Application

This change will deploy the latest monthly security patch
to the production web application using the pre-approved continuous delivery pipeline.
The deployment process is fully automated, tested, and has been executed successfully in previous cycles.
No manual intervention is required unless an alert is triggered.

## Reason for Change
To ensure the web application remains secure and compliant
with company security policies
by applying the latest security updates.

## Implementation Plan
1. Trigger deployment via the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Automated tests run in staging environment.
3. If tests pass, pipeline promotes changes to production.
4. Application observability tools monitor deployment.
5. Automated rollback if any critical errors are detected.

## Backout Plan
Automated rollback is built into the pipeline.
If deployment fails or monitoring detects issues,
the previous stable version is restored automatically.

## Risk justification
The process is fully automated,
well understood,
and has been executed multiple times without incident.
All steps are documented and monitored.

## Peer Review
Change request reviewed and approved by two team members via Confluence page collaboration.
